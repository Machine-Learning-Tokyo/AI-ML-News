# Hinton, LeCun, and Bengio have been invited to AAAI-2020 conference to give a talk
2018 ACM Turing Award winners - Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun - have been invited to thirty-fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2020) to give talks.
Here are some keynotes from their talks:
 - Geoffrey Hinton: Move on from CNN and look at Capsule Autoencoders
 - Yann LeCun: I was wrong; dump supervised learning now and try self-supervised learning 
 - Yoshua Bengio: it’s time to explore consciousness

# Powerful antibiotic discovered using machine learning for first time
A powerful antibiotic, called halicin, that kills some of the most dangerous drug-resistant bacteria in the world has been discovered using artificial intelligence.
Regina Barzilay, a senior researcher on the project and specialist in machine learning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said: “In terms of antibiotic discovery, this is absolutely a first”
