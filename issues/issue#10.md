# MONAI Open Source AI Framework for Healthcare Research
NVIDIA and King’s College London Announced MONAI Open Source AI Framework for Healthcare Research: domain-based, PyTorch-based project aids researchers developing AI in healthcare. 

[<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/AI-ML-Newsletter/blob/a3e9218f01bfb3e8add72ecc0798c2eb0be5b80f/images/MONAI.jpg" width="400"></p>](https://monai.io)

MONAI is user-friendly, delivers reproducible results and is domain-optimized for the demands of healthcare data — equipped to handle the unique formats, resolutions and specialized meta-information of medical images. The first public release provides domain-specific data transforms, neural network architectures and evaluation methods to measure the quality of medical imaging models.

# The AI For Medicine Specialization
[DeeplearningAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai) (founded by [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/)) announced their new three-course AI for Medicine Specialization:
- Course 1: AI For Medical Diagnosis
- Course 2: AI For Medical Prognosis
- Course 3: AI For Medical Treatment

The courses can be taken from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesAI4MTopButton). It typically takes 3-4 weeks, 4-6 hours per week to complete each course.

In this Specialization, you’ll gain practical experience applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine. You’ll learn how to:
- Diagnose diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images
- Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models
- Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials
- Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing

# John Horton Conway dies probably because of COVID-19 - April 11, 2020 (aged 82)
John Horton Conway was an English mathematician active in the theory of finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. Conway spent the first half of his long career at the University of Cambridge in England, and the second half at Princeton University in New Jersey, where he held the title John von Neumann Professor Emeritus. 

John Conway was famous for his invention - Game of Life. Game of Life is a cellular automaton, is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

# Image Matching Benchmark and Challenge
The second Image Matching Challenge: seeking the best end-to-end solutions for 3D image reconstruction announced. The winners going to present the approaches at [Local Features and Beyond workshop](https://image-matching-workshop.github.io) at [CVPR2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com).

Reconstructing 3D objects and buildings from a series of images is a well-known problem in computer vision, known as Structure-from-Motion (SfM). It has diverse applications in photography and cultural heritage preservation and powers many services across Google Maps, such as the 3D models created from StreetView and aerial imagery. 

We hope this benchmark, dataset and challenge helps advance the state of the art in 3D reconstruction with heterogeneous images.

# Waymo: Automated Data Augmentation
#### Building a new augmentation strategy for lidar point clouds

"Each augmentation operation is associated with a probability and specific parameters. For example, the GroundTruthAugmentor has parameters denoting the probability for sampling vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, whereas the GlobalTranslateNoise operation has parameters for the distortion magnitude of translation operation on x, y and z coordinates.

To automate the process of finding good augmentation policies for lidar point clouds, we created a new automated data augmentation algorithm - Progressive Population Based Augmentation (PPBA). PPBA builds on our previous Population Based Training (PBT) work, where we train neural nets with evolutionary computation, which uses principles similar to Darwin’s Natural Selection Theory. PPBA learns to optimize augmentation strategies effectively and efficiently by narrowing down the search space at each population iteration and adopting the best parameters discovered in past iterations."

# ACM Prize in Computing Awarded to AlphaGo Lead David Silver

David Silver was announced to win the 2019 ACM Prize in Computing for breakthrough advances in computer game-playing using deep reinforcement learning. Silver is a Professor at University College London and a Principal Research Scientist at DeepMind. His most highly publicized achievement was leading the team that developed AlphaGo, that defeated the world champion in the game Go. Silver developed AlphaGo aby combining ideas from deep learning, reinforcement learning, traditional tree-search and large-scale computing. AlphaGo is recognized as a milestone in AI research and was ranked by New Scientist magazine as one of the top 10 discoveries of the last decade.
