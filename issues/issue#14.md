IARAIâ€™s very own Sepp Hochreiter has received the prestigious Neural Networks Pioneer Award 2021 for his contributions to the development of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The award is presented annually by the Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The Neural Networks Pioneer award recognizes groundbreaking contributions to early concepts and sustained developments in the field of neural networks. The prize includes a plaque plus US$2,500 honorarium, and travel support for the recipient and one companion to attend the award presentation at a major IEEE CIS-sponsored conference in 2021.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points, but also entire sequences of data. LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data.
