# AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology

- The latest version of AlphaFold (AlphaFold-2) has been recognised as a solution to one of biology's grand challenges - the ‚Äúprotein folding problem‚Äù. 

- It was validated at CASP14, the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction

- We‚Äôre excited about the potential impact AlphaFold may have on the future of biological research and scientific discovery.
