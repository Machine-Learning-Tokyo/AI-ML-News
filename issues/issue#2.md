# Google open sourced GPipe, an Open Source Library for Efficiently Training Large-scale Neural Network Models
GPipe is a distributed machine learning library that uses synchronous stochastic gradient descent and pipeline parallelism for training, applicable to any DNN that consists of multiple sequential layers. GPipe allows researchers to easily deploy more accelerators to train larger models and to scale the performance without tuning hyperparameters.
