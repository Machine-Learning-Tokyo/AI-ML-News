# NVIDIA introduces Jetson Nano - a small AI computer

NVIDIA announced the Jetson Nano, a small AI computer that delivers 472 GFLOPS of compute performance for running modern AI workloads and is highly power-efficient, consuming only 5 watts. It comes in two versions ‚Äî the $99 devkit for developers, makers and enthusiasts and the $129 production-ready module for companies looking to create mass-market edge systems.

# OpenAI created OpenAI LP, a for-profit company

OpenAI restructured from non-profit to "capped-profit" and explained its decision in a blog post:

*We‚Äôll need to invest billions of dollars in upcoming years into large-scale cloud compute, attracting and retaining talented people, and building AI supercomputers.*


*We want to increase our ability to raise capital while still serving our mission, and no pre-existing legal structure we know of strikes the right balance. Our solution is to create OpenAI LP as a hybrid of a for-profit and nonprofit‚Äîwhich we are calling a ‚Äúcapped-profit‚Äù company.*

- The company justifies this rather high profit ‚Äúcap‚Äù by saying that if it succeeds in creating a working artificial general intelligence (AGI is a poorly defined concept that is nonetheless perhaps the Holy Grail of current AI research), ‚Äúwe expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than we‚Äôd owe to people who invest in or work at OpenAI LP.‚Äù

# Google open sourced GPipe, an Open Source Library for Efficiently Training Large-scale Neural Network Models
GPipe is a distributed machine learning library that uses synchronous stochastic gradient descent and pipeline parallelism for training, applicable to any DNN that consists of multiple sequential layers. GPipe allows researchers to easily deploy more accelerators to train larger models and to scale the performance without tuning hyperparameters.

# OpenAI released Activation Atlases

Activation Atlases: a new technique for visualizing what interactions between neurons can represent. Activation atlases build on feature visualization, a technique for studying what the hidden layers of neural networks can represent.
