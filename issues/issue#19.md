# Objectron Dataset
- Google AI has announced the Objectron Dataset in November, 2020
- Objectron Dataset is a collection of short, object-centric video clips capturing a larger set of common objects from different angles.
- To empower the research community for continued advancement in 3D object understanding, there is a strong need for the release of object-centric video datasets, which capture more of the 3D structure of an object, to aid in the training and benchmarking of machine learning models.
