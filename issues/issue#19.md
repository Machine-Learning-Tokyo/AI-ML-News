# Visdom: a data visualization tool
- Visdom is a flexible tool for creating, organizing, and sharing visualizations of live, rich data. 
- It aims to facilitate visualization of (remote) data with an emphasis on supporting scientific experimentation.
- It supports PyTorch and Numpy. 
- The Visdom project has been transitioned from Facebook AI Research to the FOSSASIA Organization in January, 2021.

# Objectron Dataset
- Google AI has announced the Objectron Dataset in November, 2020
- Objectron Dataset is a collection of short, object-centric video clips capturing a larger set of common objects from different angles.
- To empower the research community for continued advancement in 3D object understanding, there is a strong need for the release of object-centric video datasets, which capture more of the 3D structure of an object, to aid in the training and benchmarking of machine learning models.
