# Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data

UC Berkeley, BAIR released **RAD – Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data** (Michael Laskin, Kimin Lee*, Adam Stooke, Lerrel Pinto, Pieter Abbeel, Aravind Srinivas).

"We perform the first extensive study of image augmentation in the RL setting and show, surprisingly, that simple RL algorithms with augmented data achieve state-of-the-art results for data-efficiency on DeepMind control and test-time generalization on OpenAI ProcGen environments."

# CNN Explainer

CNN Explainer is an interactive visualization tool to learn, interpret and visualize CNN networks. It runs a pre-trained CNN in the browser. The CNN Explainer was created by Jay Wang, Robert Turko, Omar Shaikh, Haekyu Park, Nilaksh Das, Fred Hohman, Minsuk Kahng, and Polo Chau, which was the result of a research collaboration between Georgia Tech and Oregon State.
