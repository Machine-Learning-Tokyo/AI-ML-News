# Google announced TensorFlow Quantum: An Open Source Library for Quantum Machine Learning  
Google announced the release of TensorFlow Quantum ([TFQ](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum)), in collaboration with [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), [X](https://x.company), and [Volkswagen](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2018/06/volkswagen-tests-quantum-computing-in-battery-research.html#) an open-source library for the rapid prototyping of quantum ML models.
- TFQ provides the tools to bring the quantum computing and machine learning research communities together
    - to control and and model natural and artificial quantum systems
    - for example, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors with ~50-100 qubits
- TFQ integrates [Cirq](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/07/announcing-cirq-open-source-framework.html) and TensorFlow:
    - offers high-level abstractions for the design and implementation of both discriminative generative quantum-classical models
