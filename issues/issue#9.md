# ICLR 2020 as a fully virtual conference due to the coronavirus spreading

Due to growing concerns about COVID-19, ICLR2020 will cancel its physical conference this year, instead shifting to a fully virtual conference. We were very excited to hold ICLR in Addis Ababa, and it is disappointing that we will not all be able to come together in person in April. This unfortunate event does give us the opportunity to innovate on how to host an effective remote conference. The organizing committees are now working to create a virtual conference that will be valuable and engaging for both presenters and attendees.

# Google announced TensorFlow Quantum: An Open Source Library for Quantum Machine Learning  
Google announced the release of TensorFlow Quantum ([TFQ](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum)), in collaboration with [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), [X](https://x.company), and [Volkswagen](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2018/06/volkswagen-tests-quantum-computing-in-battery-research.html#) an open-source library for the rapid prototyping of quantum ML models.
- TFQ provides the tools to bring the quantum computing and machine learning research communities together
    - to control and and model natural and artificial quantum systems
    - for example, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors with ~50-100 qubits
- TFQ integrates [Cirq](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/07/announcing-cirq-open-source-framework.html) and TensorFlow:
    - offers high-level abstractions for the design and implementation of both discriminative generative quantum-classical models
