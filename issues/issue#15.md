# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization
- [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) announced a new specialization â€” Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 

- The course provides an exciting introduction to image generation with GANs, charting a path from foundational concepts to advanced techniques through an easy-to-understand approach.

- Build a comprehensive knowledge base and gain hands-on experience in GANs. Train your own model using PyTorch, use it to create images, and evaluate a variety of advanced GANs.

- Financial aid is available

- The GANs Specialization is launching on September 30th.
