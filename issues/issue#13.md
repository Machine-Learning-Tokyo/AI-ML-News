# MIT takes down Tiny Images dataset due to offensive content

MIT takes down 80 Million Tiny Images data set due to offensive content.

"The dataset is too large (80 million images) and the images are so small (32 x 32 pixels) that it can be difficult for people to visually recognize its content. Therefore, manual inspection, even if feasible, will not guarantee that offensive images can be completely removed. We therefore have decided to formally withdraw the dataset. We ask the community to refrain from using it in future and also delete any existing copies of the dataset that may have been downloaded. 

From the official MIT statement:

**Why it is important to withdraw the dataset:** biases, offensive and prejudicial images, and derogatory terminology alienates an important part of our community -- precisely those that we are making efforts to include. It also contributes to harmful biases in AI systems trained on such data. Additionally, the presence of such prejudicial images hurts efforts to foster a culture of inclusivity in the computer vision community. This is extremely unfortunate and runs counter to the values that we strive to uphold."

The dataset was created in 2006. 53,464 different nouns copied from Wordnet were used to automatically download images of the corresponding noun from Internet search engines at the time to collect the 80 million images (at 32x32 resolution).

# International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science

Recent advances in ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù realized artificial intelligence (AI) that surpasses humans in certain tasks like visual object recognition and game playing. Today‚Äôs AI, however, still lacks the versatility and flexibility of human intelligence, which motivates AI researchers to learn brain‚Äôs working principles. Neuroscientists also need helps of AI in making sense of massive data from sequencing, imaging, and so forth. The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers advancing the forefront of AI and neuroscience to identify next targets in creating brain-like intelligence and further advancing neuroscience.
