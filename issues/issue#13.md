# International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science

Recent advances in “deep learning” realized artificial intelligence (AI) that surpasses humans in certain tasks like visual object recognition and game playing. Today’s AI, however, still lacks the versatility and flexibility of human intelligence, which motivates AI researchers to learn brain’s working principles. Neuroscientists also need helps of AI in making sense of massive data from sequencing, imaging, and so forth. The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers advancing the forefront of AI and neuroscience to identify next targets in creating brain-like intelligence and further advancing neuroscience.
