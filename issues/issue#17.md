# AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology

- The latest version of AlphaFold (AlphaFold-2) has been recognised as a solution to one of biology's grand challenges - the “protein folding problem”. 

- It was validated at CASP14, the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction

- We’re excited about the potential impact AlphaFold may have on the future of biological research and scientific discovery.

# Grad SLAM

- gradslam is a PyTorch based open-source framework providing differentiable building blocks for SLAM systems.

- SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. 

- SLAM algorithms are used in navigation, robotic mapping and odometry for virtual reality or augmented reality.

# The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT)

- The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT) is an open-source platform for visualization and understanding of NLP models.

- LIT is for researchers and practitioners looking to understand NLP model behavior through a visual, interactive, and extensible tool.

- LIT contains many built-in capabilities but is also customizable, with the ability to add custom interpretability techniques, metrics calculations, counterfactual generators, visualizations, and more.
