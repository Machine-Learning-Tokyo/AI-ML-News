# AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology

- The latest version of AlphaFold (AlphaFold-2) has been recognised as a solution to one of biology's grand challenges - the ‚Äúprotein folding problem‚Äù. 

- It was validated at CASP14, the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction

- We‚Äôre excited about the potential impact AlphaFold may have on the future of biological research and scientific discovery.

# Grad SLAM

- gradslam is a PyTorch based open-source framework providing differentiable building blocks for SLAM systems.

- SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. 

- SLAM algorithms are used in navigation, robotic mapping and odometry for virtual reality or augmented reality.
